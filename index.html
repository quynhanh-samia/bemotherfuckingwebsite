<h1>This is the <em>Test</em> of Quynh Anh and Samia Website.</h1>
<p class="st">Really, it is.</p>
<h2>Seriously, you guys think that a website doesn't need some styling?</h2>
<p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB</p>
<p><span class="wr">WRONG </span>, hahaha.</p>
<h2>The best test website</h2>
<p>Let me describe the <em>real</em> perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsites </span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://google.com/">Google home page</a></li>
<li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
<li>Looks <em>almost</em> the same on every screen</li>
<li>Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <small>well, kind of</small></li>
<li>It's <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/">accessible</a>, so everyone can enjoy it <small>but not everyone can read this - this text is Ant-Accessible</small></li>
<li>Shit is <em>even more</em> legible than the fucking two previous versions - and it also has a cleanish style without looking like an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET">ARPANET</a> website</li>
<li>Doesn't load massive images or scripts. We should all care about people who still use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_over_Avian_Carriers">IPoAC</a></li>
<li>Uses only free and open resources. Like this ass-breaking font called "Open Sans" <small>which btw weighs 15.21kB, wtf</small></li>
<li>It doesn't load your glorious jQuery or jQueryUI with all their fucking styles and shits. Nor Angular or any other framework. This website is made with plain HTML, CSS3 and JS. Keep it Vanilla!</li>
<li>Doesn't include any tracking service <small>this website does, but hey, who cares</small></li>
<li>Images aren't forbidden, but when SVG is available <em>JUST USE IT</em>.</li>
<li>Use <em>some</em> fucking <span id="rbw" class="colored">colors </span>.</li>
<li>Links don't really need to keep that <span class="sb">shitty blue </span> the browser is giving them: nor that <span class="sv">violetish color </span> when they are marked as visited. Just give them a <a href="http://www.colorhexa.com/0077aa">nice color</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Size matters, yeah, but don't exaggerate</h2>
<p>Remember, not everybody is blind, and not everybody wants to read a fucking 2 inches letter on a 27 inches screen, so keep it cool. Don't exaggerate in size, but don't make an ant-compatible text either.</p>
<h2>Put some pictures</h2>
<div class="fancyPositioning">
<div class="picture-left"><img title="korean day6 band" src="img/day6.jpg" />
<p class="caption">DAY6 est un groupe de rock sud-cor&eacute;en produit par le label Studio J.</p>
</div>
<div class="tleft">
<p>We're not looking at a novel by Stephanie Meyer, this is a <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite </span> so include some pictures to give a context.</p>
<p>The website shouldn't be overfilled with pictures, but it should make the user happy while reading your nonsense words.</p>
<p>You see that fancy cat? He's happy, you should be too.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Yes, even this is satire.</h2>
<p>But this doesn't mean you should load your <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite </span> with shitty animations, instead keep it simple, minify its resources and use images responsibly. Remember the IPoAC users!</p>
<blockquote>Good design is as little design as possible. Some German motherfucker on motherfuckingwebsite.com</blockquote>
<p>That's not entirely true, look at that <span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite </span>. It's so minimal that it can be considered crap.</p>
<h2>Epilogue</h2>
<p>Actually this website was made to follow the trend of the&nbsp;<a href="http://motherfuckingwebsite.com/"><span class="mfw">motherfuckingwebsite&nbsp;</span></a>and the&nbsp;<a href="http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/"><span class="mfw">bettermotherfuckingwebsite&nbsp;</span></a>.</p>
<p>Despite what was said here they're beautiful and truly among the best websites on the internet (even though this is still <span class="mfw">thebestmotherfuckingwebsite </span>), so go check 'em out.</p>
<p>Seriously, follow some of the advice we gave you, they'll "make the web great again" <span class="citneed">Cit. needed </span></p>
